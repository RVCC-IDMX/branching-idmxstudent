    <h2>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</h2>

    <p>
      Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the
      cushioned seat. "Both you and the coroner have been at some pains," said
      he, "to single out the very strongest points in the young man's favour.
      Don't you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much
      imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of
      quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he
      evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outré as a dying
      reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I
      shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man
      says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And
      now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this
      case until we are on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see
      that we shall be there in twenty minutes."

      It was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passing through the
      beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found
      ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like
      man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In
      spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in
      deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising
      Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a
      room had already been engaged for us.

    <h2>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</h2>

    <p>
      The pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then “Enfield,” said
      Mr. Utterson, “that’s a good rule of yours.”
    </p>

    <p>“Yes, I think it is,” returned Enfield.</p>

    <h2>Dracula</h2>

      The Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I
      fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese and
      a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was my
      supper. During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many questions
      as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had experienced.
    </p>

    <p>
      By this time I had finished my supper, and by my host's desire had drawn
      up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me, at
      the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an
      opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked physiognomy.

    <h2>Evelina</h2>

    <p>
      Indeed, notwithstanding the attempts I so frequently make of writing some
      of the Captain's conversation, I can only give you a faint idea of his
      language; for almost every other word he utters is accompanied by an oath,
      which, I am sure, would be as unpleasant for you to read, as for me to
      write: and, besides, he makes use of a thousand sea-terms, which are to me
      quite unintelligible.

      Poor Madame Duval sent to inquire at all probable places, whether she
      could be conveyed to town in any stage-coach: but the Captain's servant
      brought her for answer, that no London stage would pass near Howard Grove
      till to-day. She then sent to order a chaise; but was soon assured, that
      no horses could be procured. She was so much inflamed by these
      disappointments, that she threatened to set out for town on foot; and it
      was with difficulty that Lady Howard dissuaded her from this mad scheme.

    <h2>The Life of Samuel Jackson</h2>

    <p>
      Johnson was some time with Beauclerk at his house at Windsor, where he was
      entertained with experiments in natural philosophy. One Sunday, when the
      weather was very fine, Beauclerk enticed him, insensibly, to saunter about
      all the morning. They went into a church-yard, in the time of divine
      service, and Johnson laid himself down at his ease upon one of the
      tomb-stones. 'Now, Sir, (said Beauclerk) you are like Hogarth's Idle
      Apprentice.' When Johnson got his pension, Beauclerk said to him, in the
      humorous phrase of Falstaff, 'I hope you'll now purge and live cleanly
      like a gentleman.'
    </p>

    <p>
      One night when Beauclerk and Langton had supped at a tavern in London, and
      sat till about three in the morning, it came into their heads to go and
      knock up Johnson, and see if they could prevail on him to join them in a
      ramble. They rapped violently at the door of his chambers in the Temple,
      till at last he appeared in his shirt, with his little black wig on the
      top of his head, instead of a nightcap, and a poker in his hand,
      imagining, probably, that some ruffians were coming to attack him. When he
      discovered who they were, and was told their errand, he smiled, and with
      great good humour agreed to their proposal: 'What, is it you, you dogs!
      I'll have a frisk with you.' He was soon drest, and they sallied forth
      together into Covent-Garden, where the greengrocers and fruiterers were
      beginning to arrange their hampers, just come in from the country. Johnson
      made some attempts to help them; but the honest gardeners stared so at his
      figure and manner, and odd interference, that he soon saw his services
      were not relished. They then repaired to one of the neighbouring taverns,
      and made a bowl of that liquor called Bishop, which Johnson had always
      liked; while in joyous contempt of sleep, from which he had been roused,
      he repeated the festive lines,
