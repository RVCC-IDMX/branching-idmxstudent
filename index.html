    <h2>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</h2>

    <p>
      Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the
      cushioned seat. "Both you and the coroner have been at some pains," said
      he, "to single out the very strongest points in the young man's favour.
      Don't you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much
      imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of
      quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he
      evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outré as a dying
      reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I
      shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man
      says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And
      now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this
      case until we are on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see
      that we shall be there in twenty minutes."
    </p>

    <p>
      It was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passing through the
      beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found
      ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like
      man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In
      spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in
      deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising
      Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a
      room had already been engaged for us.

    <h2>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</h2>

    <p>
      The pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then “Enfield,” said
      Mr. Utterson, “that’s a good rule of yours.”
    </p>

    <p>“Yes, I think it is,” returned Enfield.</p>
